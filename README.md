# DML-Assignment-UE18CS205
A repository containing the source code for the Graph Network Assignment given as a part of the Discrete Mathematics and Logic course (UE18CS205) at PES University. The objective of the assignment was to profile a graph and verify certain properties such as: 

* What is average degree of a vertex in the graph?
* Is the graph a regular graph?
* Is the graph a complete graph?
* Is the graph a cycle graph?
* Is the graph a path graph but not a cycle graph?
* Does the graph has an Euler circuit?
* Does the graph has an Euler path but not an Euler circuit?
* Does the graph satisfy the sufficient condition of the Ore's theorem?

*The assignment questions can also be found in Problem Statement.txt*
